        Slova is a documentary film about Ukraine and its people. As we portray the effects <br>
        of the ongoing war, and follow the people of Ukraine, we discover how they attempt <br>
        to carry on with their lives despite the atrocities that poison their country. The story <br>
        is told through the “storyteller” Tom Harwood, a 25 years old British-Japanese <br>
        filmmaker based in Tokyo, with strong personal connection to Ukraine.
