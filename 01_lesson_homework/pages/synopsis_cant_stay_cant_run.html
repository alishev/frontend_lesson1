 <p> 
        During the war in Ukraine, women and LGBTQI+ people face double pressure: on the <br>
        one hand, they are more likely to be vulnerable to violence than other groups of <br>
        people, on the other hand, they need to make daily decisions about their role <br>
        in the war, weighing a number of different factors such as their own safety, their family's <br>
        safety, and the need to defend and support the people and places they grew up with. <br>
        film documents and supports this experience, it aims to show how different <br>
        people find different answers in the face of hardship. Each of the film's protagonists <br>
        is a woman who is in Ukraine or abroad in the context of war, struggling with <br>
        constant changes of residence and finding themselves in an emotionally unstable <br>
        state but continues fight on their own front.
